add regular block tiles - can hold items, destructible, create animation for destroying



rewrite level reading and creation code in Level constructor - needs to be more efficient

rewrite item code to match tile code - static IDs, etc

change data loading to be consistent between entities, items, and tiles

change player entity collisions to only use local entities and to utilize a static method in Collision class
